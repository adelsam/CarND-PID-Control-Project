Reflection on hyperparameter tuning.

Initially, I started with P, I, and D coefficients from the lessons (i.e. Kp = 0.2, Ki = 0.004, Kd = 3.0), but this
caused my car to turn very sharply, oscillating back and forth and then promptly run off the track.

I lowered all of the values until I had steering angles within the model tolerance of [-1, 1].  I still found that my
car was difficult to keep centered in the lane, so I also lowered the speed from 0.3 to 0.1

I found I was able to stay on the track with Kp = 0.09, Ki = 0.0000000006, Kd = 0.0015.  I found that the left turn after
bridge was much easier to navigate than the following right turn around the lake because the I term was compensating for
average left-hand turn due to the counter-clockwise lap.

I used manual tuning, running the simulator each time and comparing my results.

As I increased the P coefficient, I noticed that I needed a much larger corresponding increase in the D coeffecient,
otherwise the car would oscillate around the center of the track but never drive straight.

I finally settled on Kp = 0.16, Ki = 0.0000001, Kd = 0.8 as the hyperparemeters form my PID controller.  I found the
larger D value gave smoother driving and keeping the I term low reduced the left-hand bias.
